# Computer Networks Project

For my computer networks module in Trinity College Dublin, I'm trying to build an encrypted chat application using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA digital signatures.
Which clearly didn't work and I'm left with a synchronus chat application. I need to make it multithreaded to make it somewhat useful
