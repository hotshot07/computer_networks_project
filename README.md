# Computer Networks Project

For my computer networks module in Trinity College Dublin, I'm trying to build an encrypted chatroom application using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA digital signatures.
Currently I've made the chat application multithreaded and it delivers the messages to other users instantly. I'm wokring on the security features as of now.
