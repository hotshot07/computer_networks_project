# Computer Networks Project

For my computer networks module in Trinity College Dublin, I have made a multithreaded chat application that sends messages to users instantly. I'm now working on adding security features like AES Encryption to the application.

I have added a file dhkesim.py to simulate how a Diffie Hellman key exchange works. I would integrate it into the chat app later.
